	"#### Online privacy & safety",
	"Concerned about someone finding out where you've been on the net? Here's how to reduce the chances that your net travels will be traced. Browsers like Internet Explorer and Firefox are designed to leave traces behind indicating where you've been and what you've been looking at on the Internet.",
	"It's difficult to guarantee your internet activity can't be traced, but you can make it harder for others to see what you've viewed. To help protect your privacy, clear your browser's cache (temporary files) and history (list of sites visited). If you share your computer, this will also erase others' history and cache.",
	"How to clear your browser history:",
	"- In your browser settings, look for options like 'Clear browsing data', 'Delete history', or 'Reset'.",
	"- Select options to remove cache, cookies, and history.",
	"- Follow the prompts to complete the process, then restart your browser.",
	"If you clear everything, others may notice. After clearing, visit a few neutral sites to refill your history and cache.",
	"\n>Note: These steps make it harder, but not impossible, for someone with technical skills to see your browsing activity. For more robust privacy, consider using a privacy-focused browser or VPN.",
